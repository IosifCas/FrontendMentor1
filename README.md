## Acknowledgments

To everyone who has walked this path of never ending learning and endless struggle, dealing with similar questions to the ones I had during this challenge, this has been an initeresting challenge. There is still room for improvement and there will be harder things to learn and master.
The goal has not been achieved yet, but this is a step forward.
