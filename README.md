## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

This practice has helped me strenghten my knowledge in the Bootstrap framework and how to properly use its containers.

### Continued development

The image shown still has to show a layer of colour over it, still working on that.

### Useful resources

- [Bootstrap containers](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/layout/containers/) - This helped me to organize the text to the left.

## Acknowledgments

To everyone who has walked this path of never ending learning and endless struggle, dealing with similar questions to the ones I had during this challenge, this has been an initeresting challenge. There is still room for improvement and there will be harder things to learn and master.
The goal has not been achieved yet, but this is a step forward.
